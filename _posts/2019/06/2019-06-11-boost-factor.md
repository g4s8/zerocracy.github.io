  Sometimes you need a larger budget for a micro-task,

In the article [_How to Push Them Forward?_]({% post_url 2019/03/2019-03-12-how-to-move-faster %})
I suggested boost factor as one of the mechanisms to force
a task, in order to make sure it completes faster than usual. The
[ยง5](http://www.zerocracy.com/policy.html#5) of our Policy explains
how it works, briefly. Even though it's a very simple procedure, it gets
many architects and programmers confused. Let me explain how it is
supposed to work.

<!--more-->

Each task has a fixed [micro-budget](https://www.yegor256.com/2018/01/09/micro-budgeting.html),
which is intended to motivate a programmer
to complete the task as soon as possible, and get the payment. We strongly
believe that professional programmers are motivated by _rewards_. In different
management models there could be different types of rewards: bonus points,
vacation days, cookies, extra days of working from home, and so on.

We, in Zerocracy, believe in the most primitive motivational instrument:
[money](https://www.yegor256.com/2014/09/24/why-monetary-awards-dont-work.html).
The better motivation we expect a programmer to have, the more we should
pay. Of course, we understand that people are pretty complex creatures
and there are many other things that motivate and de-motivate us. However,
money is what makes the motivational formula simple and transparent.

Sometimes a project may have a task that is more complex than others and it's
difficult or impossible to use [Puzzle Driven Development](https://www.yegor256.com/2010/03/04/pdd.html)
to decompose it
into smaller ones. Such a task may be related to some reseach and experiments
a programmer has to do in order to complete it. In this case, a task needs
a "boost," which means a _larger budget_.

How do we know that a task needs a boost? It's easy: programmers will
[refuse](http://www.zerocracy.com/policy.html#6)
it a number of times. A task will be assigned to someone and there will be
a rejection, very soon. Then, [Zerocrat](https://www.0crat.com) will assign it to someone else and ...
again a rejection. Pretty soon, the architect will realize that the
task requires a boost.

I would recommend to use 4x and 6x boost factors. Larger factors
will not help as much, but will only spoil the programmer who will get such
a large extra bonus and will de-motivate the rest of the team. Remember,
everybody will see that a single task got a big bonus!

Thus, my recommendation: use it carefully and only when the task was
rejected at least twice.
