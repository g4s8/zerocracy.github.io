No matter how much you [trust](https://www.yegor256.com/2017/11/21/trust-pay-lose.html)
your programmers and how motivated they are,
you have to review their results regularly, identify most critical
technical gaps, and implement corrective and preventive
actions. Savvy businesses invite [external experts](https://www.yegor256.com/2014/12/18/independent-technical-reviews.html)
to perform
independent reviews. Zerocracy can provide such an expert,
who will audit everything your technical team is working with, and report
back to you with a short few-pages-long PDF summary.

<!--more-->

There are three types of the audit:

  * Quick: 8 hours
  * Standard: 16 hours
  * Detailed: 32 hours

This is the [full list](https://www.0crat.com/team)
of our auditors available, together with their hourly
rates. To get the actual rate, take one of their rates from
the table and double it: Zerocracy and the auditor split
the fee 50/50. Pick them from the top of the table, the best auditors
have the highest reputation score.

You will have to provide us the access to your source code,
requirements documentation, continuous integration environment,
production logs, test environment, database schema (and data, if possible),
and any other digital artifact, which seems to be relevant.

The auditor won't communicate with your programmers. The auditor
only reviews the artifacts available, pretending to be a new developer
joining the team and trying to understand what's going on.

By the end of the audit, you will get a PDF report with a short summary
of what is the overall situation in the product and a list of most
critical issues. Each issue will be accompanied with recommendations
for corrective actions.

If necessary, we sign a Non-Disclosure Agreement with you, to protect
your digital artifacts and sensitive information against any possible
leakage.
