Tobias L. by email.

"I am still not convinced that people will work well for bounties.
I think it is a very fun idea, and that a lot of people will 'test the waters'---but
that long term it won't produce the best work and incentives."

Thomas K. by email.

"Unfortunately not that many projects are managed in Zerocrat way---so
this model will probably not play well in real life."
---
Artex2000 in the blog.

"Zerocracy is a disgraceful movement for computing profession."
